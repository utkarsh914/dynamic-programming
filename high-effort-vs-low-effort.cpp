You are given n days and for each day (di) you can select one of the following options:

perform no task 
perform a high effort task (hi) only if its the first day or if you chose no-task on the previous day
perform a low effort task (li)
Write a program to find the maximum amount of tasks you can perform within these n days. 


Example 1:

Input:
n = 3
hi[] = {2,8,1}
li[] = {1,2,1}
Output: 9
Explanation:
Options on 1st day: hi[0]=8, li[0]=1 or no-task
Select no-task.
Options on 2nd day: hi[1]=8, li[2]=1 or no-task
Select high-effort task as no-task was selected 
the previous day.  
Options on 3rd day: hi[2]=1, li[2]=1 or no-task
Select low-effort task as selecting high-effort 
task is only possible if you chose no-task on 
previous day.

â€‹Example 2:

Input:
n = 5
hi[] = {3,6,8,7,6}
li[] = {1,5,4,5,3}
Output: 20
Explanation: Perform high-effort task on first 
day and low-effort task on all remaining days.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function maxAmt() which accepts an integer n and two arrays li[] and hi[] as input parameter and returns the maximum amount of tasks you can perform within these n days.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)


Constraints:
1 <= n <= 106

			//current high effort plus previous to previous day's value
